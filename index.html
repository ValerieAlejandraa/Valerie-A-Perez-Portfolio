      <!--the normalize.min.css  has all the spaces and visual formatting removed, this make the code harder oto read, but it creates a smaller file size- which is very helpful when millions of websites are referencing it -->

    <h2 class="border-top">About Valerie</h2>
    <p> After graduating from the University of California, Riverside, I attended graduate school at USC for one session but soon realized I wasn't on the right financial path. I dabbled in various careers to choose the path that will be conducive to my passions and goals. After taking a few introduction courses in computer science and self-studying JavaScript, I decided to become a Software Engineer to combine my passions in tech, journalism, and literature. I love solving problems and working on code with others. It excites me to see code come to life on a screen. </p>
    <p> As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> , I begun my journey to becoming a software engineer and couldn't be happier. </p>
    <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer who displays passion, commitment, and consistency, you are at the right place! </p>
